#Project Country:

Welcome!
The goal of this repo is to show a project with Api`s and forms.

Step by step:

1) Create a component that bring a form with the following data:
- Name
- Surname
- Country (taken from a dropdown list of countries)
- Year of birth

2)Then, when the form is saved, it should show a message that says: "Hello {name} from {Country} on {day} of {month} you will have {years}".

3)Also, shows a list with all the previous visitors entries.

4)For countries, I used the following API:https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all

For the project I used and worked with:

- React Js.
- Standard Coding (ES6 / Eslint)
- localStorage 
- APIs.
